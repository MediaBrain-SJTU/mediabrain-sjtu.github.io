⚠️ This page is under building!

I'm joining Shanghai Jiao Tong University as an Associate Professor.

I'm also a PI at Shanghai AI Laboratory

I remain a visitor researcher with Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at Oxford, where I have spent seven wonderful years, completed DPhil and worked as a Senior Research Fellow afterwards.

I was fortunate to have been supervised by Professor Andrew Zisserman and Professor Alison Noble.
